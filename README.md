## Layout options section
The problem I faced in this section was the navigation between 
layouts. Without the carousel, I had a scroll option, with carousel I did not. 

I went with the scroll option because I found it easier to navigate through.

## Language support
The approach I had gives support for multiple languages.

```
language: 'en'

language_options: ['en', 'de']

text_to_display: {
  'en': 'Some en text',
  'de': 'Some de text'
}

text[language]
```
